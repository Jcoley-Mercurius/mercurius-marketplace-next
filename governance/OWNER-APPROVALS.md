# Mercurius Owner Approvals

**Owner:** Repository owner, as stated in the audit conversation
**Recorded:** 2026-08-29

| System | Disposition | Approved artifacts | Qualification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mercurius Technology System (MTS) | **APPROVED** | `mts/MTS-AUDIT.md`, `mts/TECHNOLOGY-BLUEPRINT.md`, and the current technology roadmap direction | Approval establishes the audit and blueprint as governing inputs. It does not waive their release gates or turn unverified production behavior into evidence. |
| Mercurius Product System (MPS) | **APPROVED** | `mps/MPS-AUDIT.md` and `mps/PROPOSED-MPS.md` | The proposed MPS becomes the approved product baseline. Values that the document explicitly leaves for later configuration—such as metric thresholds, exact ZIPs, and operational SLAs—remain open implementation decisions. |
| Mercurius Design System (MDS) | **APPROVED** | `mds/MDS-AUDIT.md` and `mds/DESIGN-SYSTEM-BLUEPRINT.md` | The blueprint and its recommended defaults become the design authority. Runtime rendering remains a required implementation verification gate because it was unavailable during the audit. |

The owner has stated that no additional product-authority approval chain is required. Legal, financial, privacy, security, and platform-provider constraints may still require specialist validation where the approved systems identify it.

The approved authority chain is now **MPS → MDS → MTS → implementation evidence**. No additional system-level approval is outstanding.
